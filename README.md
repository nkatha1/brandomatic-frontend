# Brandomatic AI - Frontend 🎨

This is the **Next.js 13 frontend** for Brandomatic AI, a project that generates creative brand name ideas using AI.  
It provides a simple user interface where you can enter an **industry** and a **tone**, and it will display 5 brand name ideas generated by the backend.
